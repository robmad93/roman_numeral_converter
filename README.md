# roman_numeral_converter
Simple number-to-roman-numeral converter. This is my attempt at the second Certification Project in the "Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures" course from freecodecamp.org, meaning that I had to create all code files from scratch. Feel free to try the application yourself: https://robmad93.github.io/roman_numeral_converter/
